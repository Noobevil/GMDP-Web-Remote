# GPDMP Remote
This is a simple remote for  [Google play music desktop player](https://www.googleplaymusicdesktopplayer.com/)

Its in very early stages so contains plenty of bugs! You can run it by downloading it, installing dependencies by running

```
npm install
```

The web server runs on port 8090 by default but can be customized.

This is my first nodejs app so things are still pretty wonky!
